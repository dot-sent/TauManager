# TauManager

Syndicate management software for Tau Station game (https://taustation.space)

To run this software, you'll need:

* PostgreSQL database server, version 9.3+ (might work on lower versions, but not guaranteed)
* Docker and Docker Compose for production
* .NET Core environment for develpment (I use VSCode + Kestrel)
